   # Data Analytics Project: End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from data ingestion and cleaning to analysis, visualization, and reporting. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from raw data using Python, SQL Server, and Power BI, and to present those insights in a clear, business-focused dashboard and report.

## Dataset

* **Format:** CSV
* **Description:** The dataset contains structured data used to analyze key trends, patterns, and performance metrics relevant to the business problem.

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python:** Data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

  * **Libraries:** pandas, pyodbc, sqlalchmey
* **SQL Server:** Data storage and querying
* **SQL:** Data extraction, transformation, and aggregation
* **Power BI:** Interactive dashboard and data visualization
* **Git/GitHub:** Version control and project documentation

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Loading

* Loaded the dataset into Python using pandas.
* Performed initial inspection of structure, data types, and summary statistics.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed distributions, trends, and relationships.
* Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

### 3. Data Cleaning

* Handled missing and invalid values.
* Standardized column names and formats.
* Removed duplicates and unnecessary records.

### 4. SQL Analysis

* Imported cleaned data into SQL Server.
* Wrote SQL queries to analyze customer behavior, sales, and revenue.
* Created aggregated tables for dashboard reporting.

### 5. Dashboard Development

* Connected Power BI to SQL Server.
* Designed interactive visuals to highlight key business metrics.
* Focused on clarity, usability, and insight-driven design.

### 6. Reporting

* Created a report summarizing findings, trends, and insights derived from the analysis and dashboard.
